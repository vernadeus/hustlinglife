                <h3>Step 1:</h3>
                <p>Learn about the basics! Search for W3 schools to help you take the first step. Give or take 2 weeks of learning with 2 hours per day should be enough! </p>

            <!-- Feature 2 -->
            <div>
                <h3>Step 2:</h3>
                <p>Now, watch youtube videos and do follow-alongs. However, add a twist to it: whichever is being done code by code, make your own adjustments.
                    Be it the font size, the padding, the borders etc, gradually make those little tweaks and slowly you will grow into it.

            <!-- Feature 3 -->
            <div>
                <h3>Step 3:</h3>
                <p>Start coding with chat gpt! Always tell it that the code is not good enough and you need better designs. Also tell chatgpt:
                    "add comments to what the code does". This can help you make your own adjustments down the road.
